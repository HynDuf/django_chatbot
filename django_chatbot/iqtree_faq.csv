What is the ultrafast bootstrap approximation?,A method for quickly assessing branch support in phylogenetic trees. It provides reliable support values faster than traditional bootstrap methods.
How do I interpret ultrafast bootstrap support values?,"Values above 95% indicate strong support, while values below 85% suggest weak support for a branch."
Can IQ-TREE handle large datasets?,"Yes, IQ-TREE is optimized for large datasets, using efficient algorithms and parallel computing to manage data efficiently."
What types of data can IQ-TREE analyze?,"DNA, RNA, protein, codon, binary, and morphological data, with support for mixed data types in partitioned analyses."
How do I perform a partitioned analysis?,Create a partition file specifying models for each data block. Run IQ-TREE with the `-spp` option followed by your partition file name.
How do I specify a partition file?,"A partition file lists partitions and models, e.g., `DNA, gene1 = 1-100; DNA, gene2 = 101-200`. Use the `-spp partition_file.txt` option."
Can I mix DNA and protein data in a partitioned analysis?,"Yes, specify different models for each partition in the partition file."
How does IQ-TREE treat gap/missing/ambiguous characters?,"These characters are treated as missing data and are ignored in calculations, ensuring they don't affect likelihood estimates."
What are the different phylogenetic models available in IQ-TREE?,"Includes models for DNA (e.g., GTR, HKY), protein (e.g., JTT, WAG), codon, binary, and morphological data."
How do I perform model selection in IQ-TREE?,Use the command `iqtree2 -s alignment.phy -m MFP`. IQ-TREE will automatically select the best-fit model.
How to run a basic tree inference using IQ-TREE?,"Execute `iqtree2 -s your_data.phy`, where `your_data.phy` is your alignment file. This will infer a tree using default settings."
How do I assess branch supports using nonparametric bootstrap?,"Use the `-b` option followed by the number of bootstrap replicates, e.g., `iqtree2 -s your_data.phy -b 1000`."
How does IQ-TREE compare to other phylogenetic software?,"IQ-TREE offers high accuracy and speed, often outperforming others due to its efficient algorithms and parallel computing capabilities."
"What is the SH-aLRT test, and how is it used?",A likelihood ratio test for branch support. Use it with `-alrt 1000` for 1000 replicates. It provides additional support metrics alongside bootstrap values.
How do I report a bug in IQ-TREE?,Contact the development team via the contact form on the IQ-TREE website or report issues on their GitHub page.
How do I cite IQ-TREE in my research?,"Use the citation format provided on the IQ-TREE website, typically referencing the main IQ-TREE paper by Minh et al."
What are the benefits of using the IQ-TREE web server?,"It provides a user-friendly interface, eliminating the need for command-line expertise. It also handles computational tasks on remote servers."
How can I speed up my analysis using multicore CPUs?,"Use the `-nt` option to specify the number of threads, e.g., `-nt 4` to use four CPU cores."
How do I constrain a tree search in IQ-TREE?,Use a constraint file with the `-g` option to enforce constraints on tree topology during the search.
What is the approximately unbiased (AU) test?,A statistical test to compare tree topologies. Use the `-au` option to perform this test when evaluating multiple trees.
How can I perform ancestral sequence reconstruction?,Add the `-asr` option to your command to perform ancestral state reconstruction on your phylogenetic tree.
How does IQ-TREE treat identical sequences?,"Identical sequences are merged to save computation time, with results adjusted to account for the merging."
What is the purpose of the composition test?,"To check if the nucleotide or amino acid composition is homogeneous across the dataset, helping identify potential biases."
How do I save time with standard bootstrap analysis?,"Use ultrafast bootstrap `-bb` instead, which provides faster and reliable branch support values."
What is the best number of CPU cores to use?,"Use as many cores as your system allows, balancing with other system demands. More cores generally reduce computation time."
Why does IQ-TREE complain about the use of +ASC model?,Ensure your data is appropriate for ascertainment bias correction and that the +ASC model is suitable for your analysis.
How do I simulate sequence alignments in IQ-TREE?,"Use AliSim, a tool included with IQ-TREE, to simulate alignments based on specified models and trees."
What are polymorphism-aware models in IQ-TREE?,"Models that account for within-population genetic variation, useful for datasets with population-level data."
How can I perform tree topology tests?,Use `-zb` and `-au` options to compare and test different tree topologies for statistical support.
"What is the concordance factor, and how is it calculated?","Measures the proportion of gene trees or sites supporting a branch in the species tree, calculated using specific IQ-TREE options like `-t`."
How do I root a phylogenetic tree using IQ-TREE?,"Specify an outgroup with the `-o` option, or use rooting methods like midpoint rooting after tree inference."
