"Background
Phylogenetic inference on empirical data typically
includes bootstrapping. This enables the reconstructed
tree to be annotated with support values for each of its
branches. The standard non-parametric bootstrap [1, 2]
is a popular method in which so-called pseudo-replicates
are created by sampling sites from the multiple sequence
alignment (MSA), with replacement. For every replicate,
a bootstrap tree is reconstructed by conducting an
independent search on each bootstrap MSA. The set of
bootstrap trees can then be used to build a consensus
tree, or map the support values onto the tree inferred
from the original MSA [2].
Maximum parsimony (MP) is widely used to infer phy-
logenies ([3] and references therein). Since calculating the
parsimony score is less complex and computationally
cheaper than calculating the likelihood of a tree, methods
to build MP trees have been applied to large-scale data
sets [4, 5]. However, computing the branch support for
MP trees is still time consuming especially for large data
sets. In addition to run-time limitations, the standard
bootstrap is also known to be conservative [6]: the suppor values estimated by the standard bootstrap often under-
estimate the probability that a branch is true.
Here, we introduce MPBoot, a novel method for rap-
idly approximating the MP bootstrap. MPBoot is
inspired by the ultrafast bootstrap approximation for
maximum likelihood [7]. It employs additional tree
search techniques like subtree pruning and regrafting
(SPR) and the parsimony ratchet [8]. In the following we
present the MPBoot method and a benchmark study
that compares MPBoot with the popular TNT [5] and
PAUP* [9] programs."
